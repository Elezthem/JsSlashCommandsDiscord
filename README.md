JavaScript Slash Commands

# To create a Discord bot using slash commands in JavaScript, you'll need the discord.js library and discord-api-types. Here's an example of a simple bot with one slash command:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the command line.

3. Install discord.js and discord-api-types with the following command:

```npm install discord.js @types/node @types/ws discord-api-types```

4. Create an index.js file and paste the following code: ðŸ‘†
5. Replace **'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'** with your own bot token.

Start the bot with the command:
```node index.js```

Now your bot is ready to receive the slash command `/hello`. When a user enters this command in the chat, the bot will respond with: "Hello, I am a bot!". Remember to add your bot to your Discord server and provide the necessary permissions.
